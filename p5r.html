    <h1>Atlus strikes once again - Masterpiece of a JRPG</h1>
    <h5>Written by Nathan Tan 6/1/24</h5>

    <p>Remember when Persona 5 (2016) first came out and blew collective minds in its revolutionary and inspired reimagining of the long thought dead turn-based battle RPG genre? Fans of the Persona series may have feared that Royal would be unable to leave up to the reputation of the original, especially with the advent of open world games such as Nintendo's 'Breath of the Wild' (2017) but Royal pleasantly surprises in all respects.</p>
    <p>
      This review is first divided into two parts: gameplay and then game writing, distinct components of an RPG that both need to be up to par for a great gaming experience.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Gameplay
    </h3>
    <p>
      This is definitely the area where Royal shines. Although the original Persona 5 UI is instantly iconic with its jazzy fonts and sleek design, the battle system, at its core, still held flaws from previous Persona entries, mainly issues with allocated 'dangerous' shadows in dungeons being particularly broken with little-to-no weaknesses as well as the scarcity of equipment (mainly bullets) in dungeons. Royal largely solves these issues with a complete rebalancing of both Personas and shadows as well as automatically reloading bullets every battle, making it handy to deal with that one Shadow who has a gun weakness but you have no bullets. The 'Baton Pass' system is also improved to be available from the beginning instead of only after sufficient ranks, which made it effectively useless until late game in the original. Unfortunately though, boss fights like the infamous Okamura palace, still are woefully balanced against the player even if slightly improved with the Futaba boss fight made arguably worse. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Combat isn't the only area with upgrades. A new area Kichijoji is added to the map, allowing for more activities to build up social links with confidants as well as allow for benefits in battle in relatively fun minigames. Night time, which previously was very restricted, is now basically completely open for social link work and even the visuals have been updated to perfect the already sharp Persona 5 trademark artstyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dungeons have also been redesigned to an extent to allow for more puzzle solving with a wider range of obtainable items and the mysterious Will Seeds. This reorganisation works well to vary the pace of dungeon exploration instead of your regular sneak-past-your-enemies.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Game Writing
    </h3>
    <p>
      Royal here is more of a mixed bag. As we know, the original Persona 5 is already a stacked game with an average of 102 hours per playthrough which made many doubt Royal adding even more content on top. Unfortunately, Atlus chose to keep all the original story content following the path of previous Persona enhanced versions which drags the pacing along, especially since this time there was also a lot of new story with a third trimester and two more confidants. This leads to a whopping average 120 hours per playthrough so be prepared to invest the time if you plan to purchase this game. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, how is the actual quality of the added content? Once again...mixed. Without any spoilers, while many characters that lacked much development are given additional scenes and backstory in Royal, the completely new characters of Kasumi and Maruki definitely do feel tagged on to the main story despite having some interesting interactions and backgrounds. The golden gem of Royal, the third trimester, is posed mainly as a moral quandary of what happiness truly means but unfortunately undergoes the path of immediately criticising one side over the other without properly taking the time to explore the full consequences of the questions they are attempting to ask.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Conclusion
    </h3>
    <p>
      While the various quality-of-life improvements and new or redesigned game areas manage to elevate Persona 5 Royal above the original in terms of gameplay, the new story elements put the game's quality more in question with great potential but mediocre execution. Although I certainly recommend playing this game regardless of having played the original version, the story elements are best to be watched with the purpose of being entertained rather than intellectually challenged.
