    Shamless Recopy or Worthy Addition? Portable and its lasting legacy.

    Persona 3 Portable is in a bit of a weird spot when it comes to the improved versions of the 'social link' Persona games (Golden and Royal). Although there is new content offered to play, the original story of the base Persona 3 remains unchanged and, on the less powerful Playstation Portable, the graphics look arguably worse. Upon deciding to play through this game, I was dreading having to undergo essentially the same game as the original but with a female, however, Portable is able to carve itself its own unique experience.

  <p>
    Like all other reviews, I will be dividing it into two sections: technical aspects in gameplay and then the game's writing. 
  </p>
  <h3>
    Gameplay
  </h3>
  <p>
    Although the overworld map is greatly reduced from the base version (I'll go through <em>that</em> later), dungeon exploring and battle mechanics are copied identically except with a few balancing changes and one large fix. There's nothing particularly wrong with the battle graphics of Persona 3 for its time, the game was criticised for the inability to choose other characters' moves despite being able to do so in earlier games. Of course, this never happened again after Portable resolved the issue and made battles about skill instead of luck again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, onto the promised topic: the decision to reduce the enhanced version from the Playstation 2 to a home console. Despite Atlus having released Persona games on the console before, they were merely remasters with an updated UI unlike Portable which had the new female protagonist route. This is immediately felt upon starting the game where you realise that, outside of cutscenes, the game is no longer in third person and relies on the D-pad to move the character. I initially despised this change but, over time, grew to respect its efficiency and speed. In fact, by the end of the game, you get used enough to the low-quality sprite models which don't play too much of an impact anyway. With a portable console, the lower quality is worth it for maintaining the fps and overall smoothness of the game.

  <h3>
    Game Writing
  </h3>
  <p>
    For a franchise that is supposedly only targeted towards males, the decision to include a female protagonist (the second after Eternal Punishment) definitely raised question marks for me first. But, having played through the game, I now ask where did all the risk that Atlus had go? One continual point against getting an enhanced version is having to essentially go through the same base plot but find nuggets of new content throughout. Although Portable still mostly copies the base version, viewing it from the lens of a different protagonist (not only in gender but also personality) increases the pull to the game and spawns infinite potential for reshaping social interactions, which the game definitely pulls off.  
  </p>
  <h3>
    Conclusion
  </h3>
  <p>
    Thus, although I must recommend to not be surprised when playing through Portable that you are largely seeing the base version, I believe Portable takes enough risky creative devisions in its game design that should afford one playthrough, if only to see the appeal of the female protagonist route.
